# Claude Code Project Instructions

## Security Rules
- NEVER read, display, or output the contents of `.env`, `.env.local`, or any file containing API keys or secrets.
- NEVER commit `.env` files or any files containing credentials.
- When working with environment variables, only reference `.env.example` for variable names — never actual values.
- If a user accidentally pastes an API key, warn them immediately.
